# wildfire_viz_demo
Partial python adaptation of JS script by Pierre Markuse(@pierre_markuse) for wildfire and burn scar visualization in Sentinel-2 images

Original script is here: https://pierre-markuse.net/2018/04/30/visualizing-wildfires-burn-scars-sentinel-hub-eo-browser/

You need only *numpy & matplotlib* to run this demo


Used in mass processing of images for a project about field fires (mainly due to stubble burning) in Ukraine, by Texty.org.ua. We've found and processed thousands satellite photos from burning areas by Sentinel-2 to visualize scale of a problem. 
The project is here: https://texty.org.ua/projects/104757/v-ukrayini-shoroku-blyzko-30-tysyach-pozhezh-yak-vony-vyhlyadayut-iz-kosmosu/
Right now it's in Ukrainian only, but with many interesting pictures.
